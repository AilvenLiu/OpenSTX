# Daily Trading System v0.1 Documentation

## Overview

The Daily Trading System is designed to automate the process of trading stocks using various machine learning models. The system includes functionalities for real-time trading, continuous learning, and backtesting. This document provides an overview of the system's design, structure, and usage.

## System Structure

The system is organized into several modules:

1. **Main Module**: Entry point of the system.
2. **Model Training Module**: Contains functions for training and updating models.
3. **Real-time Trading Module**: Handles real-time trading operations.
4. **Continuous Learning Module**: Continuously updates models with new data.
5. **Backtesting Module**: Evaluates the performance of models using historical data.
6. **Strategy Module**: Contains trading strategies and signal generation logic.
7. **Data Fetching and Preprocessing Module**: Handles data fetching and preprocessing.

## Main Module

The main module initializes the system, starts data loading, and launches threads for continuous learning and real-time trading.

### Main Function

The `main` function is the entry point of the system. It performs the following steps:
1. Reads the database configuration.
2. Initializes the data loader with the specified symbols.
3. Starts the data loader.
4. Trains the models using the data loader.
5. Performs backtesting to evaluate the models.
6. Starts continuous learning and real-time trading in separate threads.
7. Joins the threads to ensure they run continuously.
8. Stops the data loader when the process is terminated.

### Usage

To run the system, execute the `main` function. This will start the data loader, train the models, perform backtesting, and start the continuous learning and real-time trading threads.

## Model Training Module

This module contains functions for training various machine learning models, including LSTM, Transformer, ARIMA, GARCH, and RandomForest.

### Functions

- **train_models**: Trains all models using the provided data loader.
- **update_model**: Updates a general machine learning model with new data.
- **update_lstm_model**: Updates an LSTM model with new data.
- **update_arima_model**: Updates an ARIMA model with new data.
- **update_garch_model**: Updates a GARCH model with new data.
- **update_transformer_model**: Updates a Transformer model with new data.
- **update_ml_model**: Updates a machine learning model with new data.

### Usage

To train the models, call the `train_models` function with the data loader. To update the models with new data, use the respective update functions.

## Real-time Trading Module

This module handles real-time trading operations by fetching data, making predictions, generating trading signals, and executing trades.

### Real-time Trading Function

The `real_time_trading` function performs the following steps:
1. Continuously fetches data at specified intervals.
2. Preprocesses the fetched data.
3. For each symbol, makes predictions using the trained models.
4. Generates trading signals based on the predictions and actual prices.
5. Executes trades based on the generated signals.

### Usage

To start real-time trading, call the `real_time_trading` function with the required parameters. This function will run in a loop, continuously fetching data, making predictions, generating signals, and executing trades.

## Continuous Learning Module

This module continuously updates the models with new data to ensure they remain accurate and up-to-date.

### Continuous Learning Function

The `continuous_learning` function performs the following steps:
1. Continuously fetches new data at specified intervals.
2. Preprocesses the fetched data.
3. For each symbol, updates the models with the new data.
4. Prints a success message after updating the models.

### Usage

To start continuous learning, call the `continuous_learning` function with the required parameters. This function will run in a loop, continuously fetching new data and updating the models.

## Backtesting Module

This module evaluates the performance of the models using historical data to ensure they are effective before deploying them in real-time trading.

### Backtesting Function

The `backtest` function performs the following steps:
1. Iterates through the data loader to get historical data for each symbol.
2. Uses a rolling window approach to split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Makes predictions on the test set using the trained models.
4. Calculates performance metrics for the predictions.
5. Selects the best model based on the Sharpe ratio.

### Usage

To perform backtesting, call the `backtest` function with the required parameters. This function will return the backtest results and the best model based on the Sharpe ratio.

## Strategy Module

This module contains trading strategies and logic for generating trading signals based on model predictions and technical indicators.

### Functions

- **generate_strategy**: Generates a random trading strategy.
- **evaluate_strategy**: Evaluates a trading strategy.
- **select_best_strategy**: Selects the best trading strategy.
- **bollinger_bands**: Calculates Bollinger Bands.
- **macd**: Calculates the MACD line and signal line.
- **rsi**: Calculates the RSI values.
- **generate_trading_signals**: Generates trading signals based on model predictions and technical indicators.

### Usage

To generate trading signals, use the `generate_trading_signals` function with the required parameters. This function will return the generated signals based on the model predictions and technical indicators.

## Data Fetching and Preprocessing Module

This module handles data fetching from the database or memory and preprocessing the data to ensure it is ready for model training and predictions.

### Functions

- **fetch_data**: Fetches data from the database or memory.
- **preprocess_data**: Preprocesses the data by converting dates, setting the index, sorting, and dropping missing values.
- **preprocess_symbol_data**: Preprocesses data for a specific symbol.

### Usage

To fetch data, use the `fetch_data` function with the required parameters. To preprocess the data, use the `preprocess_data` or `preprocess_symbol_data` functions.

## Overall Usage

To use the Daily Trading System, follow these steps:

1. **Setup**: Ensure that the database configuration is correctly set up in the `db_config` file.
2. **Run the Main Module**: Execute the `main` function to start the system. This will initialize the data loader, train the models, perform backtesting, and start the continuous learning and real-time trading threads.
3. **Monitor**: Monitor the system's output to ensure that models are being updated and trades are being executed as expected.
4. **Adjust Parameters**: If necessary, adjust the parameters for model training, continuous learning, and real-time trading to optimize performance.

By following these steps, users can effectively deploy and manage the Daily Trading System for automated trading, continuous learning, and backtesting.

## Conclusion

The Daily Trading System v0.1 is a comprehensive solution for automated trading using machine learning models. By following the structure and usage guidelines provided in this document, users can effectively deploy and manage the system for real-time trading, continuous learning, and backtesting.
